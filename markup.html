        <h1 style="text-align:center;"> "Acceptance" </h1>
        <p style="text-align:center;"> <br> Get out of your room, <br>Let your mind calm down. <br> Let your <em> eyes </em> roam, <br> To the <strong> beauty </strong> around.</p> 
        <p style="text-align:center;"> Those <em> toxic thoughts </em> in your mind, <br> Are <em> poison </em> to your heart. <br> <strong> It's okay to not be fine,</strong> <br> Know that'll be alright.</p> 
                <p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>Don't compare yourself, </strong> <br> Embrace your flaw. <br>Take the <em> negativity </em> off the shelf, <br> Just let yourself go then <strong> grow.</strong> </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center;"> Pick your <em> sadness </em> away, <br> Let it flee through the air. <br> Close the door on <em> self-hatred,</em> <br> <strong> Start loving who you are. </strong><br>
                        <p style="text-align:center;"> Focus on your <strong> goals,</strong> <br> Never lose your fight. <br> It's time to open new scrolls. <br> You're strong; <strong> You can do it :)</strong> </p>
