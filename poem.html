        <h1 style="text-align:center;"> "Acceptance" </h1>
        <p lang ="eng" style="text-align:center;"> <br> Get out of your room, <br>Let your mind calm down. <br> Let your eyes roam, <br> To the beauty around.</p> 
            <p style="text-align:center;"> Those toxic thoughts in your mind, <br> Are poison to your heart. <br> It's okay to not be fine, <br> Know that'll be alright.</p> 
                <p style="text-align:center;"> Don't compare yourself, <br> Embrace your flaw. <br>Take the negativity off the shelf, <br> Just let yourself go then grow. </p>
                    <p style="text-align:center;"> Pick your sadness away, <br> Let it flee through the air. <br> Close the door on self-hatred, <br> Start loving who you are.<br>
                        <p style="text-align:center;"> Focus on your goals, <br> Never lose your fight. <br> It's time to open new scrolls. <br> You're strong; You can do it :) </p>
