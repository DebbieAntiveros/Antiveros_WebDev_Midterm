        <p> <h1> "Acceptance" <h1> <br> Get out of your room, <br>Let your mind calm down. <br> Let your eyes roam, To the beauty around. <br> <br> Those toxic thoughts in your mind, <br> Are poison to your heart. <br> It's okay to not be fine, <br> Know that'll be alright.
<br> <br> Don't compare yourself, <br>Embrace your flaw. <br>Take the negativity off the shelf, <br> Just let yourself go then grow. <br> <br> Pick your sadness away,
<br> Let it flee through the air. <br> Close the door on self-hatred, <br> Start loving who you are. <br> <br> Focus on your goals, <br> Never lose your fight.
<br> It's time to open new scrolls. <br> You're strong; You can do it :)
