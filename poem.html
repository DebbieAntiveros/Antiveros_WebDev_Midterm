        <p> "Acceptance" <br> Get out of your room, <br>Let your mind calm down. <br> Let your eyes roam, 
To the beauty around. <br> <br> Those toxic thoughts in your mind, <br> Are poison to your heart.
It's okay to not be fine,
Everything will be alright.

Don't compare yourself, 
Embrace your flaw. 
Take the negativity off the shelf,
Just let yourself go then grow.

Pick your sadness away,
Let it flee through the air. 
Close the door on self-hatred, 
Start loving the way you are. 

Focus on your goals,
Never lose your fight.
It's time to open new scrolls.
You're strong; You can do it.
